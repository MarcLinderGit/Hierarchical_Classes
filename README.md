# Hierarchical Classes

## Introduction

This Python project  demonstrates the use of hierarchical classes and object-oriented programming (OOP). While the project itself is relatively simple, it showcases the power and structure that can be achieved with OOP.
In this project, I've established a fictional restaurant chain, "Basta Fazoolin' with my Heart," and expanded it to include a new restaurant, "Take a' Arepa." I've structured the project using a set of classes representing menus, franchises, and the overall business, showing how these elements can be hierarchically organized.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several sections, each with a specific focus:

1. **Creating Menus**: I've defined a `Menu` class, demonstrating the principles of object-oriented programming. I've created menus for different meal times, such as brunch, early bird, dinner, and kids.

2. **Franchises**: I've introduced the `Franchise` class to illustrate how I can manage multiple restaurants or franchises under the same business. I've created and managed two franchises, the flagship store, and a new installment.

3. **Business Management**: The `Business` class shows how I can oversee multiple franchises and menus within a business. I've created a business called "Basta Fazoolin' with my Heart" to manage the franchises.

4. **Expansion**: The project takes a step further by introducing a new restaurant, "Take a' Arepa," demonstrating the flexibility of the code to accommodate growth.

## Usage

To run the code and explore the restaurant management system:

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Execute the code provided in the Python environment of my choice.
3. Observe how hierarchical classes allow for easy management of menus, franchises, and businesses.

## Functionality

The key functionalities of the project include:

- Creating menus for different meal times and calculating bills for customer orders.
- Managing franchises with specific addresses and available menus.
- Structuring businesses that oversee multiple franchises.
- Expanding the system to accommodate a new restaurant, "Take a' Arepa."

## Conclusion

The project, while simple, serves as an excellent example of how object-oriented programming can be used to organize, manage, and scale a restaurant business. By following the provided code and comments.
The project can be a foundation for further expansion, features, and enhancements, making it a valuable learning resource for me for further advanvcements into object-oriented programming and Python development.
